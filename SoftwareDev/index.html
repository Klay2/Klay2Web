        <h2>Professional</h2><br>
          <p>I am an adult returning student beginning a career in software development.
            The majority of my experience is in Java, Android and Web Deveopment.  I will
            be graduating from the University of Wisconsin in the spring of 2017.  I am
            working on several projects including a production version Android app called
            Walking Distance. <p><br>
          <h2>Resume</h2>
            <p>Get straight to the buiscuits and grab a resume: LINKHERE</p><br>
          <h2>Languages and Platforms</h2><br>
            <p>- 2 years of experience using Java including 6 months of
              Android programming and two months of Java servelets.  In Android
              programming I am familiar with asynchronous code and gps sensor and
              background service implementation.  In regards to servlets I have
              experience interacting with databases by creating queries and
              forming JSON responses to use with the GSON library.<p><br>
            <p>- 1 year of experience with C programming.  My C experience is
              limited to using the standard libraries mostly for school projects for
              which I have created custom data structures and custom libraries.<p><br>
            <p>- I use both Mac and Linux as development platforms.  I am familiar enough
               with the UNIX  command line to navigate directories, redirect output and input,
               ssh into servers to work remotely,
               scp files to and from remote servers, compile projects, and do some simple
                BASH modifications to add command line functions and add custom folder paths.</p><br>

            <p>- 2 months of experience working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
              I've built this website and the ThingPile App from scratch using
              no bootstraps or templates.</p><br>

            <h3>WalkingDistance</h3><br>
            <p>-WalkingDistance is an Android app that sends users
             promotional materials depending on their GPS location.  I am working
                on a production level release of this app with my partner,
                Grisha Kamishnakov. LINK AND SPELLING!!</p><br>
            <h3>Details:</h3><br>
            <p>-WalkingDistance Details: The App started out as a project for
              my mobile programming course at the UW-Madison.  The primary
               use of the app is intended to get potential clients walking by businesses
               on the street into stores.  On the original project
              I created 70% of the Object Model code comprised of the model object
              design and list adapter code design.  I created a background service
              that sets up and receives GPS updates via a dedicated handler thread.</p><br>
               <p>I also created the code in the Main Activity that upon receiving coordinates
               from the background thread asynchronously sends an HTTP message to a Java
               servelet that runs a database query using these coordinates to get corresponding
               geo-linked promotion objects.  I used Heroku to create a starter Java Servelet
               and modified it to run the query and return JSON converted Objects.
              For the production scale app so far I have created a more robust background service
              that downloads promotions and uses a cache file so that it can download promotional
              Objects while the Main Activity of the App is paused.  Check my App page for more
              information regarding the production level WalkingDistance App:  LINKHERE!!!</p><br>
              <h3>ThingPile</h3><br>
                <p>ThingPile is a webApp I am creating that is a modular custom organization and display tool that
                  will be free to use for all non-commercial users. (likely free for everyone..)  You can check
                  it out and use it from my App page:  LINKHERE!!!</p><br>
              <h3>Details:</h3><br>
                <p>Mainly, ThingPile is a project I am using to learn JavaScript and server coding.
                  It will feature client accounts, login, and social media integration(FaceBook and then others).
                  I'm going to start out using Heroku as a service and will first write the server code in Java.
                  For security  I am going to implement "salted slow hashing" of passwords.</p><br>
